# Kernel Development Context Files

A collection of structured context files to accelerate kernel development with AI assistance.

## What is this?

This repository contains documentation and context files specifically designed to help AI assistants (like Claude) effectively assist with Linux kernel development. Each file provides the background knowledge, conventions, and practical information needed to work in different areas of the kernel.

## Quick Start

Browse the `common/` directory for general kernel development information, then dive into specific `subsystems/` for area-specific guidance.

## Why Context Files?

AI assistants are powerful tools for development, but they work best with clear context. Kernel development is particularly complex, with:
- Decades of accumulated conventions
- Subsystem-specific requirements
- Complex build and test environments
- Unique debugging approaches

These files provide that context in a structured, reusable way.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please ensure your additions are:
- Accurate and tested
- Well-structured and clear
- Referenced to official documentation where appropriate

## Getting Started with Kernel Development

If you're new to kernel development, start with:
1. `common/building.md` - Learn how to build the kernel
2. `common/booting.md` - Learn how to boot your kernel
3. `common/debugging.md` - Learn debugging fundamentals
4. Choose a subsystem guide based on your interests
